  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <div class="important">
    <p>My name is Hamza Naeem. I am a 30 year old born in Lahore, Pakistan. I was
      born in the year 1987 and moved to the United States as an immagrant with my
      parents who were seeking room for advancement. I moved around alot in my
      childhood to cities like Queens, Houston, St. Louis, San Antonio, and
      Portland respectively. I graduated high school from Tom C. Clark High School
      in San Antonio. I then attended <span class="school">University of Texas at San Antonio</span> and then
      was offered a football scholarship to <span class="school">Culver-Stockton College</span> where I played
      collegiate football for two years before moving back to San Antonio to
      finish up at University of Texas at San Antonio(UTSA) where I graduated with
      a Bachelors degree in Biology with a Minor in Chemisrty. I began working as
      a non tenured lecturer at UTSA then moved to Portland to begin my life as a
      programmer in 2017. My hobbies include; playing basketball, going on hikes,
      reading, and now coding. The reason I chose the life of a programmer is
      because of the high demand for the trade and my uncle who has been in the
      tech industry suggested I check out Epicodus specifiacally and that his
      company would hire graduates from Epicodus on the spot. In combination with
      the lack of room for advancement and improvment career-wise in my previous
      field of work and the high demand in this new industry I have now chosen I
      feel strongly about my desicion to move forward in my new field.
